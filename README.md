# CacheLab Project

## Introduction
The CacheLab project is a comprehensive systems programming exercise designed to deepen your understanding of memory hierarchy and cache behavior. This project offers hands-on experience with cache simulation, optimization, and analysis to identify and minimize cache misses.

## Project Objectives
- Implement a **cache simulator** that accurately models the behavior of cache memory.
- Optimize the cache hit rate by improving the locality of your code.
- Analyze the impact of cache parameters like block size and associativity on performance.

## Design and Architecture
The CacheLab project consists of two major parts:
1. **Cache Simulator**: A software tool that simulates cache operations given various parameters, producing detailed miss/hit statistics.
2. **Optimization Challenges**: Various tasks where you refactor and rewrite given programs to minimize cache misses, thus improving overall performance.

## Installation and Setup
To set up and use the CacheLab project:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
3. Compile the project:
    ```bash
    make all
    ```

## Usage Instructions
1. To run the cache simulator:
    ```bash
    ./csim -s <num-of-sets> -E <num-of-lines> -b <block-size> -t <tracefile>
    ```
   Example:
    ```bash
    ./csim -s 4 -E 1 -b 4 -t traces/yi.trace
    ```

2. To run the optimization tasks, refer to the specific instructions in the `optimize` directory.

## Implementation Details
- **Cache Simulator**: Simulates the cache behavior with varying parameters. Reports hits, misses, and evictions.
- **Optimization Challenges**: Code refactoring to minimize cache misses using techniques like blocking, prefetching, and loop transformations.
